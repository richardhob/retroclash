Installing Clash
================

Check out `clash-lang.org/install <https://clash-lang.org/install>`__ to install
the latest stable release of Clash, or to setup a Clash project.

Get Clash from source
---------------------

Get the source code using
`Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F>`__ and
enter the cloned directory:

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:clash-lang/clash-compiler.git

   # Alternatively, if you haven't setup SSH keys with GitHub:
   # git clone https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler.git

   cd clash-compiler

To check out a released version, use:

.. code:: bash

   git checkout v1.2.3

To checkout a release *branch* use:

.. code:: bash

   git checkout 1.2

Note that release branches might contain non-released patches.

Cabal
^^^^^
To use Cabal you need both Cabal and GHC installed on your system. For Linux and
MacOS users we recommend using `ghcup <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/>`__.
Windows users are recommended to use the
`Haskell Platform <https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html>`__.

To run `clash` use:

.. code:: bash

   cabal v2-run --write-ghc-environment-files=always -- clash


If this fails, make sure you've got an up-to-date package index:

.. code:: bash

   cabal update

Stack
^^^^^
`Install Stack <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/>`__
and run:

.. code:: bash

   stack run -- clash

Nix
^^^
Or `use Nix <https://nixos.org/nix/download.html>`__ to get a shell with the
``clash`` and ``clashi`` binaries on your PATH:

.. code:: bash

   nix-shell
